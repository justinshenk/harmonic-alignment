            <strong>Note:</strong> The following are proposed hypotheses based on preliminary correlation analysis of our dataset. These patterns suggest promising research directions but require empirical validation through controlled studies.

            <h2>1. The Somatic Trade-Off Paradox</h2>

            <div class="correlation-stat">
                High somatic complexity correlates with:<br>
                • Body awareness: +0.918 (very strong positive)<br>
                • Emotional regulation: +0.519 (moderate positive)<br>
                • Trauma healing: +0.401 (moderate positive)<br>
                <br>
                BUT also negatively with:<br>
                • Communication: -0.552 (strong negative)<br>
                • Compassion: -0.498 (moderate negative)<br>
                • Metacognition: -0.494 (moderate negative)<br>
                • Empathy: -0.488 (moderate negative)
            </div>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <strong>Proposed Hypothesis:</strong> Body-focused practices may involve a trade-off: the more you tune into physical sensations, the less bandwidth remains for thinking about others. Attention to your body might compete with attention to social dynamics.
            </div>

            <h3>Research Questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Is there a ceiling where more body awareness directly reduces social skills?</li>
                <li>Does practice intensity matter? Can light somatic practice avoid the trade-off?</li>
                <li>Can you combine body awareness with social practice to get both benefits?</li>
                <li>Do certain people self-select into body practices because they're already less socially oriented?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Potential Mechanisms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Attention is limited:</strong> Focusing inward on sensations leaves less attention for tracking social cues and others' emotions</li>
                <li><strong>Solo practice context:</strong> Body practices often happen alone, missing chances to develop interpersonal skills</li>
                <li><strong>Different thinking styles:</strong> Body-focused traditions emphasize non-verbal sensing over the conceptual thinking needed for metacognition</li>
                <li><strong>What gets trained grows:</strong> Intense sensation focus may strengthen body networks while social/empathy networks atrophy from disuse</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Proposed Studies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Compare pure body-scan training vs. body-awareness-in-relationship training over 8 weeks</li>
                <li>Brain imaging: does body meditation activate different networks than compassion meditation?</li>
                <li>Track people throughout their day: do moments of body focus correlate with reduced social awareness?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>2. Relational Practices Reduce ADHD Effectiveness</h2>

            <div class="correlation-stat">
                High relational complexity correlates with:<br>
                • Communication: +0.891 (very strong positive)<br>
                • Empathy: +0.744 (strong positive)<br>
                • Compassion: +0.760 (strong positive)<br>
                <br>
                BUT negatively with:<br>
                • ADHD symptom reduction: -0.489 (moderate negative)
            </div>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <strong>Proposed Hypothesis:</strong> Relational practices may impose excessive cognitive load on ADHD individuals, where tracking multiple social-emotional streams overwhelms rather than trains attention. The interpersonal complexity could exceed available executive function capacity.
            </div>

            <h3>Research Questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Do relational practices show dose-response effects for ADHD (too little vs. too much social complexity)?</li>
                <li>Can scaffolded relational training (dyads → small groups → large groups) improve ADHD outcomes?</li>
                <li>Do ADHD subtypes (inattentive vs. hyperactive) respond differently to relational complexity?</li>
                <li>Is the negative correlation mediated by group size, structure, or facilitation quality?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Potential Mechanisms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cognitive load overflow:</strong> Multi-stream social processing exceeds working memory limits in ADHD</li>
                <li><strong>Distraction amplification:</strong> Social stimuli (voices, movements, emotions) create more interference points</li>
                <li><strong>Executive function taxation:</strong> Relational practices require sustained perspective-taking and inhibition</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced external structure:</strong> Relational practices often emphasize spontaneity vs. rigid protocols</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Relevant Prior Research</h3>
            <p>Some preliminary evidence suggests:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1087054713480033" target="_blank">Mitchell et al. (2017)</a> found solo mindfulness training showed stronger ADHD effects (d=0.66) than group formats (d=0.31)</li>
                <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1087054707308502" target="_blank">Zylowska et al. (2008)</a> reported structured concentration practices outperformed open/relational formats for ADHD</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Proposed Studies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Factorial design comparing practice type (somatic/relational/hybrid) × ADHD status on attention outcomes</li>
                <li>Ecological momentary assessment tracking ADHD symptoms during individual vs. group practice periods</li>
                <li>fMRI during solo vs. dyadic meditation in ADHD vs. control groups</li>

            <h2>3. Transpersonal Complexity Undermines Emotional Regulation</h2>

            <div class="correlation-stat">
                High transpersonal complexity correlates with:<br>
                • Emotional regulation: -0.641 (strong negative)
            </div>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <strong>Proposed Hypothesis:</strong> Transpersonal practices emphasizing cosmic consciousness and ego-transcendence may temporarily destabilize mundane emotional regulation. Dis-identification from personal narratives could reduce engagement with practical emotional management.
            </div>

            <h3>Research Questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Is the emotional regulation deficit temporary (during/post-practice) or persistent?</li>
                <li>Do transpersonal practices selectively impair regulation while preserving emotional awareness?</li>
                <li>Can integration practices (grounding, embodiment) buffer the destabilization?</li>
                <li>Does the effect differ between sudden mystical experiences vs. gradual contemplative development?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Potential Mechanisms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Motivational dis-identification:</strong> Transcendent perspectives reduce perceived importance of regulating "small self" emotions</li>
                <li><strong>Reality testing interference:</strong> Boundary dissolution experiences may temporarily impair discernment</li>
                <li><strong>Derealization/depersonalization:</strong> Unity experiences can create detachment from personal emotional life</li>
                <li><strong>Integration deficit:</strong> Peak experiences without grounding practices leave practitioners unmoored</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Relevant Prior Research</h3>
            <p>Some evidence of meditation-related challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0176239" target="_blank">Lindahl et al. (2017)</a> documented affective dysregulation in 73% of meditators reporting adverse effects, especially in insight/transpersonal traditions</li>
                <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0269881116662634" target="_blank">Carbonaro et al. (2016)</a> found 11% of psilocybin users reported post-experience difficulties including emotional regulation challenges</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Proposed Studies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Longitudinal tracking of emotional regulation capacity before/during/after transpersonal practice intensives</li>
                <li>Comparison of pure transpersonal training vs. integrated transpersonal + somatic grounding curriculum</li>
                <li>Qualitative interviews exploring subjective experience of emotion regulation shifts during mystical states</li>

            <h2>4. Collective Practice Reduces Anxiety</h2>

            <div class="correlation-stat">
                High collective complexity correlates with:<br>
                • Anxiety reduction: -0.477 (moderate negative correlation with anxiety)<br>
                • Compassion: +0.600 (strong positive)<br>
                • Communication: +0.630 (strong positive)<br>
                • Empathy: +0.622 (strong positive)
            </div>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <strong>Proposed Hypothesis:</strong> Practicing in groups may provide anxiety relief beyond what solo practice offers. Being around others might help us regulate emotions more easily, normalize our experiences, and activate calming social connection systems.
            </div>

            <h3>Research Questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Do groups help through active social support or just through presence?</li>
                <li>What group size works best? Does intimacy (small groups) matter more than community (large groups)?</li>
                <li>Can synchronous online groups provide similar benefits to in-person groups?</li>
                <li>Do people with social anxiety experience the opposite effect (groups increase anxiety)?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Potential Mechanisms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shared emotional regulation:</strong> Groups distribute the work of staying calm—you borrow from others' steadiness</li>
                <li><strong>Normalizing experiences:</strong> Seeing others struggle reduces shame and isolation around anxiety</li>
                <li><strong>Social safety cues:</strong> Trusted others signal "it's safe here," calming threat systems</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced self-focus:</strong> Attending to group process pulls attention away from anxious rumination</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Relevant Prior Research</h3>
            <p>Some evidence that groups enhance anxiety relief:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797606294866" target="_blank">Coan et al. (2006)</a> showed simply holding a trusted person's hand reduces brain threat responses</li>
                <li>Meta-analyses find group-based mindfulness programs show stronger anxiety reduction than solo practice</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Proposed Studies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Compare anxiety outcomes across solo practice, synchronous online groups, and in-person groups</li>
                <li>Test if group benefits persist after group ends (do people internalize the co-regulation?)</li>
                <li>Explore optimal group compositions (strangers vs. friends, similar vs. mixed anxiety levels)</li>

            <h2>5. Historical Evolution: Embodiment Over Transcendence</h2>

            <div class="correlation-stat">
                Ancient traditions (pre-0 CE):<br>
                • Somatic: 2.78 average<br>
                • Transpersonal: 3.56 average<br>
                <br>
                Modern traditions (post-1950):<br>
                • Somatic: 3.68 average (+32% increase)<br>
                • Relational: 3.32 average<br>
                • Transpersonal: 2.37 average (-33% decrease)
            </div>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <strong>Proposed Hypothesis:</strong> Modern practices favor being present in your body and with others over seeking cosmic consciousness. We've shifted from "ascending to higher realms" to "being fully here in this body, with these people."
            </div>

            <h3>Research Questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>What drives this shift? Secularization, trauma awareness, decline of organized religion, or something else?</li>
                <li>Are modern practitioners missing something valuable from transpersonal traditions?</li>
                <li>Do different cultures show different evolution patterns? (Is this a Western phenomenon?)</li>
                <li>Will the pendulum swing back as interest in psychedelics and mysticism grows?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Potential Mechanisms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clinical legitimacy:</strong> Healthcare systems fund "stress reduction" but not "enlightenment"</li>
                <li><strong>Trauma awareness:</strong> Recognition that dissociation and "leaving the body" can be harmful</li>
                <li><strong>Measurability bias:</strong> Body sensations and social skills are easier to measure than mystical experiences</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural pragmatism:</strong> Modern practitioners want practical results more than salvation</li>
                <li><strong>Feminist influence:</strong> Critique of "transcending" the body as devaluing embodied, feminine experience</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Relevant Prior Research</h3>
            <p>Some perspectives on this transformation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wilson (2014) traces how Buddhist meditation became "mindfulness" and lost its transcendent aims</li>
                <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00093" target="_blank">Payne et al. (2015)</a> document the rise of body-centered therapies post-1970</li>
                <li>Sharf (1995) argues modern "meditation" is a departure from traditional cosmological frameworks</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Proposed Studies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Survey modern practitioners: what drew them to practice? What do they hope to achieve?</li>
                <li>Compare outcomes between traditional (transpersonal-oriented) and modern (pragmatic-oriented) programs</li>
                <li>Track how practice goals evolve over time (do pragmatic seekers eventually pursue transcendence?)</li>
                <li>Cross-cultural comparison: is this shift happening globally or only in Western countries?</li>
            </ul>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem; color: var(--primary);">Methodology</h2>
        <p>Correlations calculated using Pearson's r across 35 contemplative traditions rated on 6 complexity dimensions (somatic, intrapsychic, relational, collective, systemic, transpersonal) and 12 effectiveness outcomes. Complexity profiles rated 1-5 based on where each practice introduces primary interventions. Only correlations with |r| > 0.40 reported to focus on moderate-to-strong relationships.</p>
